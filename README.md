this is an example in the roblox game Phantom Forces.
## Why ?
Imagine this: 
you want to watch youtube or something but want to play with a crosshair but the crosshair program are just centered on the screen. Thats why i made this hell of a program. And why would you want to use it ? Its great for shotguns and quickscoping. Yeah... thats all.
### Example usage
